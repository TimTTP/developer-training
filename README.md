# Developer Training Repo

This is the Developer Training Repo for Golioth. Here we have two main items:
* [The Docusaurus v2 based website](https://golioth.github.io/developer-training/) that includes all training material
* A submodule that is the Magtag-Demo code. This can also be [access directly and followed on GitHub](git@github.com:golioth/magtag-demo.git)

## Testing and Deploying

Docs pages can be tested locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Docs can be deployed to the live page by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
