# Golioth Training Code of Conduct

Golioth offers training to the public both in-person and remotely. We expect community members to abide by the following

## Code of Conduct Expected of Members

Golioth is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the Golioth organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Golioth event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the Golioth organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Golioth community, and/or removal from an event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Golioth organizer immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.
