# Sensor Introduction

The sensor section builds on what you learned during the Basic I/O exercises. We will show how to define a sensor in the devicetree, and how to activate the libraries to support that sensor using the Kconfig system.

* Set up and use a sensor that has a driver built-in to Zephyr
  * Record sensor data on Golioth LightDB stream
* Set up and interact with a sensor that doesn't have a Zephyr driver
